    <string name="story">" People were close to the environment when they asked if they would gain intelligence or not.
 The environment is everything from races to the earth and space.
At that time, people knew that manipulating numbers would cause a mysterious phenomenon, not intellectually but empirically.

 Over time, in the ancient Greek era, he created a magic square in the world of mathematics in an attempt to preserve it.
 However, because of the emphasis on leaving it, it has become a thing that is not close to the environment at all, just to match the total of vertical, horizontal and diagonal.

 And although it is gradually returning to its original form in modern times, such as weather forecasts and virtual reality, it is still far from being completed.

 A number master, who instinctively knows the original numbers.
 You may just not be awake.
 Discard the conceptual numbers and wake up to the real numbers."</string>
    <string name="hint_for_accessibility">This game is sliding puzzle.
However, you are free to decide where to start and in which direction.
Also, if all of the vertical total, horizontal total, and diagonal total match, the score will be higher.</string>
